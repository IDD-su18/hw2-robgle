We chose to implement a text entry mechanism based on a familiar maze game called Dexterity. There are ten holes on the device, with each connected to a discrete switch. Two ball bearings are to to be moved in position, to two of the ten holes. When the ball bearings are positioned inside a hole, the circuit is completed and a letter is shown on the display. The reason to select this text entry technique was to introduce a fun element in a familiar game, while at the same time, making it adequately challenging to enter text.

To implement character recognition, we stored character codes as arrays, and compared each with the given input into the device. When there was a match, the character was printed on the display.

The physical device was constructed from birch plywood available at the Jacobs institute. Laser cutting was used to cut out separate pieces of the wood with the holes, and the bottom enclosure, while acrylic was used to cover the top of the device.
